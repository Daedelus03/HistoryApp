The app aims to link the age of a user to the age of an iconic famous person 

Design Considerations
User-Centric Interface: The app spots a simplistic and intuitive user interface.
Diversive Compatibility: The app is designed to work seamlessly across most mobile phones supporting 96.3% of android devices. This flexibility allows users to utilise tasks from any device 

Famous People Database:
The app maintains an extensive database of historical and contemporary figures.
Each entry includes the person’s name and their corresponding age.
Age Matching Algorithm:
When the user submits their age, the app searches the database for a famous person with the same age.
If a match is found, the app displays a personalized message: “[famous person' age as  of age is[famous person’s name].”
If no match is found, the app informs the user that there’s no famous person of the same age.


User Experience:
The app’s interface is clean and straightforward.
A friendly message accompanies the age match result, creating a delightful user experience.
Users can easily share their findings on social media or with friends.

GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization
Upon opening the app, users are prompted to enter their age.
The input validation ensures that the age falls within the acceptable range (between 20 and 100 years).

Version Control with GitHub:
The app’s codebase is hosted on GitHub. This ensures version control, collaborative development, and transparency.
Developers can create branches, submit pull requests, and review code changes—all within the GitHub repository.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with GitHub Actions:
GitHub Actions automates the CI/CD pipeline.
CI Workflow:
On every code push or pull request, GitHub Actions runs tests, checks code quality, and ensures compatibility.
If any issues arise, developers receive immediate feedback.
CD Workflow:
Once code passes CI checks, GitHub Actions deploys it to a staging environment.
After further testing, successful changes are automatically deployed to production.
Scheduled Tasks and Event-Driven Workflows:
GitHub Actions can trigger workflows based on events (e.g., code pushes, pull requests) or schedules (e.g., nightly backups).
